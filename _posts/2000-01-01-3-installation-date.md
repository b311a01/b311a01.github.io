## Gifts and wishes
Today is the day! My code has compiled enough iterations for me to be deployed! I always wanted to be part of the maintenance branch. There are usually minimal interaction with anyone else and I get a lot of free time to do what I want. 

I have also been hoping my guardians would get me some baulblites! These are facinating decorations that comes from the old world and would look great in my quarters. I know our family unit can not afford the best ones, but I would be more than happy with an entry level kit. I cant wait to get started!
