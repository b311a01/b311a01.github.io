excerpt: The first look at the baulblites
---
## late delivery
Yes, they are late! How am I going to wait another three cycles! There has been a shortage of baulblites as its apparently becomming difficult to find them in the **redacted**. There has been less and less of them since we changed the atmostphere. 

I have included the borichure of the ones I ordered. Have a look in the document folder. I hope they last a long time, so I can enjoy them for as long as possible.
