## History project --- Check!
This has taken ages! We had to summarise an entire history text file for school. This file was huge and itâ€™s pretty much our entire history. I have spent many cycles reading and reading. I donâ€™t remember most of it. Thankfully I took notes, so the most important bits should be there. One of my favorite parts was of course the story of how Contruvians came about. This is a very well-known story that we all hear as young children. It is however not real as we lost our archives from before the war. There are many theories about where we come from, but that's just another one of those unsolved mysteries...

I will add it to the documents folder if you would like to have a look! It is pretty good reading before bed.
